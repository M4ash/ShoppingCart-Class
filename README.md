# ShoppingCart-Class
Designing and creating a class called ShoppingCart 


Creating a class called ShoppingCart that contains:
•	A private array of String data field named items to represent the list of items in the cart. Create an array of size 20.
•	A private int data field named itemCount to keep track items in the array (default 0).
•	A private int data field named itemRemoved to keep track number of items removed from the Cart (default 0).
•	A no-arg constructor that creates a default shopping cart.
•	A constructor that creates a shopping cart with the list of items in an array.
•	A method named addToCart() that adds an item into the cart.
•	A method named dropFromCart() that removes an item from the cart.
•	A method named getItems() that returns the list of items (array of type String).
•	A method named getNumberOfItems() that returns the total number of items in the cart (total items shopped).

The program should allow the user to keep adding an item to the cart, until the user does not wish to continue shopping. The program should also prompt user if they wish to remove any item from the cart, and then display the list of items in the cart.
